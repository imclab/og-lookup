#About

Simple [OpenGraph](http://ogp.me/) metadata lookup written in Node.js. Built in 30 minutes after Programming Social Web Applications presentation from [Jonathan LeBlanc](http://www.jcleblanc.com/) at ConvergeSE. Uses [JSDOM](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) to parse DOM. Built on [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

###Example
Here is an example lookup of mailchimp.com: [http://og-quickcheck.herokuapp.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmailchimp.com](http://og-quickcheck.herokuapp.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmailchimp.com)

###Note
This is a proof of concept, it is incomplete and easy to break. Here is a [blog post](http://blog.stephenwyattbush.com/2011/06/27/scraping-open-graph-metadata-with-node/) about it.
